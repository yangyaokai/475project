## 1. Background

## 2. Convolutional Neural Network
Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of  deep, feed-forward artificial neural network applied to analyzing visual  imagery using a variation of multilayer perceptrons designed to require minimal preprocessing. In our project, a CNN called  AlexNet, which improves it performance by deepening its model is applied.
